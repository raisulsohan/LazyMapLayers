# Decisions

Short records of choices that change or extend `docs/PLAN.md`. Newest last.

## D1 — Global audience (2026-09-17)

- **Context.** The first plan draft leaned on Bangladesh examples.
- **Decision.** LazyMapLayers is built for motion designers worldwide.
  - Demos, tests and data packs are global.
  - Complex-script support is tested across many scripts; Bengali is one of them.
  - The UI is English, with a translation system.
- **Consequences.** Milestone A becomes a world flight demo. Local admin packs become global
  boundary packs (geoBoundaries).

## D2 — No Google, Bing or Esri imagery built in (2026-09-17)

- **Context.** Being free and open source does not change a tile provider's terms. Those terms bind
  whoever fetches the tiles, and LazyMapLayers would download, cache and render tiles into frames
  outside the provider's product. Details:
  - **Google Maps Platform** forbids pre-fetching, caching, bulk-downloading and using its content
    outside its services. Its geo guidelines also forbid extracting imagery or making offline copies.
  - **Bing Maps for Enterprise.** Free (Basic) accounts were retired on 2025-06-30, and the service
    ends in 2028.
  - **Esri World Imagery** needs an ArcGIS subscription, and its session tokens may not be used to
    export tiles.
- **Decision.** We ship only sources that allow commercial video use with attribution:
  - NASA Blue Marble and Black Marble.
  - A local Sentinel-2 cloud-free mosaic builder, using Copernicus open data.
  - A catalogue of national open orthophoto services.
  - An import for Google Earth Studio's 3D tracking export. The user renders in Google's own tool
    under Google's terms, and we align layers on top.
  - Any XYZ, WMTS or PMTiles URL the user brings, at their own responsibility.
- **Consequences.** Global imagery is free at up to about 10 m per pixel. Street-level imagery is
  free only where a government publishes it openly.

## D3 — Build-time and type-only packages (2026-09-17)

- **Decision.** Added dev dependencies beyond the approved list:
  - `@maplibre/geojson-vt` (ISC) and `@maplibre/vt-pbf` (MIT), to cut Natural Earth into vector
    tiles at build time. Both come from the MapLibre organisation, and MapLibre already depends on
    them.
  - `@types/node` (MIT), for type checking only.
- **Consequences.** None of them ship in the panel bundle.

## D4 — Our own CEP bridge instead of CSInterface.js (2026-09-17)

- **Context.** Adobe's CSInterface.js says it may be distributed "in accordance with the terms of
  the Adobe license agreement", which is unclear for an MIT project.
- **Decision.** `src/panel/cep.ts` talks to `window.__adobe_cep__` directly and implements only what
  we use.

## D5 — Host scripts are pure ASCII (2026-09-17)

- **Context.** ExtendScript reads BOM-less .jsx files in the system code page.
- **Decision.** `tools/build.mjs` writes `dist/host/lazymaplayers.jsx` with every non-ASCII
  character as a backslash-u escape. Developer .jsx tools are kept ASCII with `tools/ascii.mjs`. The
  panel sends arguments to the host as ASCII-escaped JSON, and the host's JSON writer escapes
  non-ASCII too.

## D6 — Offline Natural Earth basemap to zoom 6 (2026-09-17)

- **Decision.** `data/generated/natural-earth.pmtiles` is built by
  `tools/prepare-natural-earth.ts`. It uses 1:110m for z0–2, 1:50m for z3–4 and 1:10m for z5–6,
  and MapLibre overzooms beyond z6.
  - Layers: ocean, land, coastline, countries (with 26 name languages), country_points,
    boundaries, admin1_lines, lakes, rivers, places.
  - Size: 24 MB, gzip-compressed MVT, built in about 9 s.
- **Consequences.** Natural Earth 1:10m has no more detail to give past about zoom 6. Detail beyond
  that comes from regional OpenStreetMap downloads (Phase 4).
